# Btrfs kernel patch submission

This document lays out the basic workflow for submitting kernel patches to the
linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org mailinglist.  We're still beholden to email for
patch submission and review, but these tools will help us track the patch review
status so we can be more effective with our review time.

Mailinglist: linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org

## Project page and tracking

Patch review queue: https://github.com/btrfs/linux/projects/1, with the
following workflow:

1. send patch to mailinglist, open an issue in btrfs/linux (you can use helper scripts, see below)
2. column *Incoming queue, pending* is for all new patches
3. column *To review* is for patches that we need to focus on and that we want to get merged soon
4. column *In misc-next* tracks all patches that pass review, testing and their final version landed in the branch [misc-next](https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-devel/tree/misc-next)

There are 2 more columns that adjust the priorities of review:

- *Urgent review* has patches that fix a serious bug and should be merged to an -rc
- *Long-term, nice to have reviews* is for more intrusive patch series, eg. new
  features, core updates

Patches come all the time, new features, fixes, urgent fixes, RFCs, patch
iterations. The time of merge depends on the nature of the patches, phase of
the development cycle so it may take time before the project card gets moved to
'To review'.  You can continue looking at any patches, replying to mailing list
with comments or Reviewed-by as usual, it'll be appreciated later when the time
comes.

Labels are used to give a visual clue of what needs attention:

* green labels
   * **misc-next** - patch is in misc-next branch
   * **for-next** - patch is in a topic branch for testing and added to the
     linux-next branch but still needs reviews or testing
   * **name ACK** - somebody under 'name' has reviewed the patch and marked the
     issue as such, though the mailing list review notices are ok too
   * **test sent** - as a response to 'test needed' red label
* blue labels
   * **partial** - part of a patches has been merged, the issue subject is for
     the whole patchset and there are clones of the issue with patch group that's
     being added separately (suffix to the subject like 1..10)
   * **5.11** - target version number for patches that are postponed to that
     development cycle, a temporary reminder after code freeze
* yellow labels
   * **name COMMENTS** - somebody under 'name' has comments that should be
     addressed and possibly patches resent
* red labels
   * **update** - an update is expected, until then nothing may happen with the
     patchset until a iteration is sent
   * **test needed** - patch is fixing something that ought to have fstest
     testcase, send it and change the label to **test sent**
   * **tricky** - problems expected, testing is recommended to identify potential
     fixes ahead of time, may also depend on other subsystems or tools

## Git commit messages

Follow the standard kernel commit message guidelines.  In addition, please keep
the following in mind.

- If you are fixing a regression from a specific commit, it's nice to add the
  Fixes: tag.  You can accomplish this using the "fixes" alias found in
  config/gitconfig, using `git fixes <bad commit>` to get the correct format for
  your Fixes: tag.
- For lockdep fixes, crash fixes, warnings, please include the lockdep message
  and stack trace in the commit
- If you get a spelling mistake flagged by the commit-msg hook that is not a
  mistake, please add it to scripts/btrfs-dict and then run `make` in that
  directory and commit the results so that we can all benefit from not having
  false positives for spelling.

## Prerequisites

### Github cli tools

The github cli tools, which can be found here

  https://github.com/cli/cli/releases

NOTE: You must install this on a box that can open a web browser, because you
need to get the 0auth token.  This is fairly straightforward

1. Install the gh package.
2. run `gh auth login`.  This will launch the browser to the 0auth stuff, follow
   the prompts.
3. [OPTIONAL] If you have a headless machine that you do development on, you
   willl need to copy the 0auth token to this machine.  Copy
   ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml to the machine you will be using for development.

### Git config options

These should be set irregardless of wether you are going to use the helper
scripts, simply copy the contents of configs/gitconfig into your ~/.gitconfig so
you get properly formatted emails for submitting.

Please run `btrfs-setup-git-hooks <git dir>` to add the appropriate git hooks to
your tree.  This will help reduce the workload on the maintainers and reviewers
of your code by ensuring that patches are in the proper format and that commit
messages are spelled correctly.

## The btrfs helper scripts

These will generate the github issues for you and send the emails as
appropriate.  Copy these somewhere and chmod u+x, or simply add the scripts/
directory to your `$PATH`.

## Developer workflow

1. `git format-patch` your patch series (please make sure your ~/.gitconfig is
   set properly so they get formatted correctly.)

   * For a patch series: `mkdir patches; git format-patch -o patches -#`
      * This generates a patches/0000-cover-letter.patch, please fill this in
        with the description of the series before sending.
   * For a single patch: `git format-patch -1`

2. `btrfs-send-patches <patches|0001-<whatever>.patch>`.  This will invoke
   `git send-email` for you, and will generate the github issues with the links
   for you.

3. If you receive feedback on a patch and the reviewer doesn't move your issue
   to the "Incoming queue, pending" stage of the project, please do that so
   people know you are working on those patches.

## Reviewer workflow

1. Check the project page for anything in the 'To Review' queue, pick a series
   to review.

2. Review the patches.

3. Mark them with your reviewed tag if you accept, mark with your comment tag if
   you have comments and move to the "Incoming queue, pending" stage of the
   project.

## Maintainer workflow

1. Tag with the appropriate target tag.  Some big patch series aren't destined
   for the next merge window, so tags are used so developers know when to expect
   their patches to be merged.

2. If it's merged into misc-next, move it to the 'In misc-next' stage.

3. Once the series is in Linus's tree the issue can be closed.
